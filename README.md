-Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets

In this project, both n-grams and sequential models were used for text tokenization and vectorization, and corresponding machine learning techniques were applied to predict whether a Tweet is about a disaster or not.

Multi-Layer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and XGBoost were used for n-grams classification, and LSTM for sequential classification.

Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel and a regularization parameter of 0.3 recorded the best result with an accuracy score of 0.81.
